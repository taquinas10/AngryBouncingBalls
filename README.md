# AngryBouncingBalls
Hit spacebar to spawn new balls. The ones bouncing against the angry one turn angry. Initial ball stays angry longer initially. Balls have mass proportional to size^2. At current parameters around 13 balls yields a stable population. 

This is me experimenting with collisions and physics for fully elastic impacts..
IMAGEPATH is path of balls and needs to be set to wherever u put the ball images
